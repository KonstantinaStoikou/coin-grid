A C program that finds recursively the best path to collect maximum possible coins.
##Calling the program
The grid can be given either as a text file by running the program as: 
``` 
./robot < grid.txt
```
or by giving the grid after calling the program. The size of the grid must first be defined 
and then the grid must be given, by symbolizing C as cells with coins and . as empty cells:
``` 
./robot < grid.txt
3 4
C..C
.C..
CC.C
```
